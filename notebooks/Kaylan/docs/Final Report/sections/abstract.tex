This report details the design, development, and verification of a gesture-based turn signaling system intended to enhance the visibility and safety of cyclists, skateboarders, and scooter riders. Utilizing inertial measurement units (IMUs) integrated into a jacket, the system processes arm gestures to activate corresponding LED signals for turns and stops. Our development focused on the design of four main subsystems: sensors, control, power, and LEDs. Through testing, the device demonstrated over 90\% accuracy in gesture recognition, effectively translating these gestures into visible LED signals.
