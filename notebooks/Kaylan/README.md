# 2024-02-14 - Discussion with TA Sanjana Pingali

Sanjana gave us the idea to have LEDs on the front of the wearable for visibility for drivers in front of the user. Additionally we might have to design and create our own breakout board for the IMUs so I will 
be looking into that in the near future.

# 2024-02-19 - Proposal

When working on the proposal, we decided on removing the back shoulder LEDs and running a longer strip from the wrists up to the shoulder area and then wrapping it above the shoulder to the upper chest. This way
we can reduce the load on the battery as well as integrating some front facing lights as discussed with our TA. Visual aid for reference:
