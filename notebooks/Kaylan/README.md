# 2024-02-14 - Discussion with TA Sanjana Pingali

Sanjana gave us the idea to have LEDs on the front of the wearable for visibility for drivers in front of the user. Additionally we were told we might have to design and create our own breakout board for the IMUs so I will be looking into that in the near future.

# 2024-02-19 - Proposal

We are currently working on the proposal rewrite and we decided on removing the back shoulder LEDs and running a longer strip from the wrists up to the shoulder area and then wrapping it above the shoulder to the upper chest. This way we can reduce the load on the battery as well as integrating some front facing lights as discussed with our TA. Visual aid for reference:

I am currently looking into creating a schematic for the IMU breakout board and found that the schematic for the breakout board we were planning on using (Adafruit LSM9DS1 Accelerometer + Gyro + Magnetometer 9-DOF Breakout) has their [schematic](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-lsm9ds1-accelerometer-plus-gyro-plus-magnetometer-9-dof-breakout/downloads) published online. We will likely use this as a reference if we are asked to manufacture the breakout board from scratch.
